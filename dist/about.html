          <p>
            Hi! I am a 23 y/o Slovak guy, who likes to code. I began to be interested in programming
            in high school, where I had a Java professor. In 4th year of high school I have found
            that Unity exists and began to work with it. Created some simple games and learnt C#.
            Later on college I learnt C and little bit of Java. I learnt C++. In 2017 I was asked to
            program a
            <a href="https://onemandevz.itch.io/gopniksimulator" target="_blank"
              ><span class="text-secondary">Gopnik Simulator</span></a
            >, and I thought "Sure, this will be great experience". And so I did it. I had lot of
            time so I began to learn MERN stack, JavaScripts and mastered CRM. Later I though:
            "Alright. Time to move to full-time developer". So I did that. Now I am creating react
            applications and plugins to CRM - in C#. I am keen to learn new technologies. We gotta
            move forward, as fast as the IT world is.

            In my early years before college I worked in several restaurants as a part-timer. There
            I learned how to be patient and how to talk to customers.

            In April 2016 I started working as a support operator in Millennium. There I learned MS
            Dynamics, MSSQL and broaden my knowledge of C#. During this period I have created a game
            called

              ><span class="text-secondary">Gopnik Simulator</span></a

            from Germany I learned basics of React, React Native, Docker. This led to learning the
            whole MERN stack alongside with Redux, GraphQL, Webpack and other technologies.

            In July 2019 I became a developer for the Millennium. I create and maintain React apps
            in various projects. Currently I am creating an intern app for a international client.
